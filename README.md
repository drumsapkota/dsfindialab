A place to experiment with Dream School Foundation apps

What are the most important things to improve about DSFINDIA.ORG?
- Easy Understanding / Structure / Keeping it simple / Making it easy to find what you're looking for
- Design

Ideas
Maybe keep the design the same and try improving the structure first.
So If we don't finish we'll atleast have reasonable content with an old design, instead a new design with bad content.
First (real) commit ;D
